    <p>The three artifacts presented in the carousel above are found in Hunter
College’s Centro: Center for Puerto Rican Studies, are posters/pamphlets
which all symbolize the importance of Nuyorican arts. The
first artifact I found was a pamphlet about the New
Rican Village. Pamphlets are usually known for providing information on a
subject, and is made to be distributed to people who usually have little to
no knowledge on the subject. The New Rican Village was a non-profit
organization that highlighted Puerto Rican culture in Loisaida. The pamphlet
states that the New Rican Village was seen as a workshop where many
Puerto Rican artists and members of the community came to
work on their crafts. A place where you can freely practice
on any skits, dances, music, recite your poetry, and showcase your
art work. Giving Puerto Rican artists the opportunity to refine and
present their work within this space. This artifact highlighted the idea that
this inter-arts center would create innovative developments to expand outside
of the establishment and revitalize the Lower East Side, starting with
performing at parks in the Lower East Side. The main portion of
this pamphlet explores the importances of Puerto Rican culture
like Afro-Latino music/dances. A mix of the Afro-Puerto Rican
Bomba y Plena, Afro-Cuban music and Latin jazz. Along with theatre and art
exhibits that reflect the Puerto Rican culture in New York City in fusion
with a relationship tied to the Island itself. In relation to the term
“fusion”, the artifact continues to highlight the visibility of two
identities, one being Puerto Rican and the other being a Puerto Rican from
New York City (Nuyorican). As the pamphlet states,</p>

<p>“There are thousands of Puerto Ricans in New York City. They need a place to discover the meaning of their unique cultural transition and experience. They need a place to express themselves in their own terms. They need a forum in which to perfect and perform music, dance, theater and other art forms that they can’t present in other channels.”</p>

<p>This artifact brings to light that Puerto Rican cultural practices were
excluded from other multi-faceted art spaces and this space wanted to bridge
that gap.</p>

<p>Since there wasn’t the internet, there were flyers/posters
passed around to inform other artists and people to go and attend shows or
to join programs and events that the New Rican Village is hosting. Which
brings me to the second artifact I found that ties to the New Rican Village
was a flyer called, The Sunday Jam Sessions. Inviting other musicians to go
and experiment with their craft along with other musicians. This creates a
community within the center. It welcomes experimentation and innovation.
Developing ways to allow a community to express themselves.</p>

<p>This particular poster pursues to push is the idea of
“Renaissance”. The artifact makes visual a political presence. You see a
cultural rebirth play out visually through the poster. I think
this illustration of the inter-arts community, and fusion of Puerto Rican
roots/history and Nuyorican culture that the New Rican Village wants to
embody through art-ivism (activism spoken through art). The term Nuyorican is
visually represented in this poster also. The different artists and different
talents being drawn are important representation of The Nuyorican Movement,
where it is a cultural and intellectual movement involving poets, writers,
musicians, artists, and actors.</p>

<p>In what is now the location of the Pyramid Club, The New
Rican Village was a cultural arts center located on 101
Avenue A between 6th and 7th streets. A center where Puerto
Ricans and Latinos can express the Latino arts. As illustrated in the
artifacts, the New Rican Village was a forum for Puerto Rican
dance, music, theater, visual arts and poetry. It predominantly established
the Puerto Rican Arts. Founder of The New Rican Village, Eddie Figueroa
who was a member of the Young Lords, established this
cultural arts institution to reflect the aesthetic of Puerto
Rican roots with a twist of avant-garde.</p>

<p>It started with one of the Young Lords Party announcements at
Tompkins Square Park in 1969. To highlight activism by the
Young Lords within the context of the Lower East Side. In an
interview Eddie, just before his passing in 1990, elaborated on why the
Lower East Side was ideal for an inter-arts institution like the New Rican
Village, “There was all this energy down on the Lower East Side and so I
opened up the New Rican Village there. We brought together all of the arts,
with philosophy, a belief system, a dream vision, all of these things
together without a business perspective–that’s what allowed the shit to fly,
cause it was so fuckin’ loose. You could come in and create whatever it is
that you wanted to do man.” Many known names in New York Puerto Rican
Communities like Pedro Pietri, Miriam Colon Jerry Gonzalez,
Sandra Maria Estevez  were able to headline and showcase
their work at the New Rican Village. Figueroa’s intentions
were to fuse the old traditional Puerto Rican roots with the
new culture of Puerto Ricans in New York City.</p>

<p>The NRV was open from 1976 to 1979, but continued to open in
other locations. The reason for the New Rican Village being so shortly lived
was because Figueroa made some clumsy and bad business choices and soon ran
out of funds to stay at the Lower East Side location. After a successful run
of about four years, Figueroa gave up the space, but refused to sell any
interest of his ventures to any outside investors. He then continued the
ultimate goal of the New Rican Village, “A Puerto Rican Renaissance” in other
venues.</p>
